### What?

When ready, this Vagrant project will start up an Alfresco instance inside a VM.

### How?

As it is using [Vagrant](http://vagrantup.com) and [Librarian](https://github.com/applicationsonline/librarian),
you must install those before going further.

Now, lets just follow these steps:

1. `librarian-chef install`
2. `vagrant up`

That should be it. Really, there are no more steps. Only it does not work...and I do not have time to get it
to work at the moment.

But if you have some time available I would be very pleased if you could help me out.
